polyframe
=========

**Multi-monitor remote desktop for Linux — your remote cursor follows you across monitors.**

> ### 🏴‍☠️ Pirates with ethics
> **polyframe is a fork of [ReFrame](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/reframe) by [Alynx Zhou](https://github.com/AlynxZhou), licensed under Apache-2.0.**
> Every bit of the hard part — the DRM/KMS capture, the Wayland/NVIDIA/headless/login support, all of it — is Alynx's work. polyframe only adds cross-monitor cursor handling on top. **If you want the upstream project, go [star ReFrame](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/reframe).**

## What polyframe adds

ReFrame runs one capture/input server **per monitor**, which is the right design — but on Wayland compositors (e.g. COSMIC/`cosmic-comp`) an *absolute* pointer device is confined to a single output, so the system cursor can't move between monitors. polyframe adds **follow-the-cursor**:

- Each per-monitor streamer publishes which monitor currently holds the cursor (detected from the DRM cursor plane each frame) to a small flock-guarded file under `/run/reframe`.
- When you interact with a monitor that doesn't currently have the cursor, polyframe relocates it there — one short burst of relative motion on a dedicated relative-only `uinput` device (a single huge `REL_X` is ignored/capped by libinput; many small steps a few ms apart are honored, related to [#36](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/reframe/issues/36)) — then forwards the absolute event for precise placement.
- **Within** a monitor it's pure absolute input, so normal movement stays smooth and pixel-accurate.

### One VNC server per monitor

Like ReFrame, polyframe runs a separate server — and its own VNC port — for **each** monitor (e.g. the left monitor on `:5933`, the right on `:5934`). You connect one client/view per monitor (side-by-side panes work great). Follow-the-cursor ties them together: the single system cursor moves to whichever monitor's view you're driving, then tracks precisely there.

### Config

One new per-monitor key, `position-x` — the monitor's real X position on the virtual desktop (e.g. left monitor `0`, right monitor `1920`). Keep `monitor-x=0` and `desktop-width` at each monitor's own width so absolute positioning stays full-range per monitor. See [`dists/example.conf`](./dists/example.conf).

**Known limitation:** cross-monitor drag-and-drop isn't handled yet.

ReFrame Remote Desktop
======================

DRM/KMS based remote desktop for Linux that supports Wayland/NVIDIA/headless/login…
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Where Are My Users?

I am really interested in how ReFrame helps you in your daily life! Please send email to [alynx.zhou@gmail.com](mailto:alynx.zhou@gmail.com) and tell me about how you use ReFrame. If you feel good about it, don't forget to star this repo and introduce ReFrame to others!

# Features

If you are interested in contribution, you may read [HACKING.md](./HACKING.md) first which should be helpful.

## What ReFrame Currently Supports

- **VNC**
- **Wayland**/X11/**TTY**
- Intel/AMD/**NVIDIA**/[Even **Raspberry Pi**!](https://reframe.alynx.one/#rpi)/[Enter more GPUs that can run a general Wayland compositor…]
- Pointer/Keyboard
- **Remote Login**
- Headless Setup
- Draw Remote Cursor

## What ReFrame May Support in Future

- **RDP**: PRs are always welcome.

## What ReFrame Won't Support

- **Sound**: VNC does not have sound support.
- **No GPU/connector/EGL/OpenGL ES/DRM/KMS**: Even llvmpipe should work.
- **Game Streaming**: VNC is not optimized for low-latency. Consider game streaming optimized solutions like [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/).
- **DRM Overlay Plane**: Currently only a few compositors support overlay plane as an experimental feature, mostly for passing video frames to overlay plane so they don't need to decode and composite those frames and let hardware deal with those frames to reduce power consumption. However handling such overlay planes in ReFrame only means moving such decoding and compositing operations from compositor to ReFrame (and due to natural limitations it is not reliable), thus you get no benefits. So you could just disable overlay plane support in your compositor.

# Requirements

A GPU that:

- supports **DRM/KMS**.
- has a proper **EGL/OpenGL ES** implementation.
- is able to output to monitors.

If you can run a modern Linux desktop environment, it is likely you already meet these requirements.

## Build from Source

### Dependencies

- glib2 (as well as gio, gmodule, gobject)
- gtk4 (for clipboard support in reframe-session)
- libdrm
- libepoxy
- libvncserver
- libxkbcommon
- systemd (optional but recommended)
- meson
- ninja (or other building tools that Meson supports)
- gcc (or clang)

The default VNC implementation is libvncserver, if you want to build the optional neatvnc implementation (`-D neatvnc=true`), you will also need the following dependencies that neatvnc requires:

- neatvnc
- aml
- pixman
- zlib
- ffmpeg

### Build

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AlynxZhou/reframe.git
$ cd reframe
$ mkdir build && cd build && meson setup --prefix=/usr . .. && meson compile
# meson install
```

# Usage

> **Security Suggestion**: VNC data streams may not be encrypted even with password authentication, so **NEVER** expose this to public network directly! Connecting to it via VPN is recommended.

1. Run `systemctl start reframe-server@example.service`.
2. Try connecting to it with a VNC client via port `5933`.

If you have only 1 connected monitor and you never rotate it, it should work out of the box without modifying the example configuration. If it cannot find your monitor, you need to manually select monitor via DRM card and connector. If you can see screen content, but cannot control it, you need to manually load `uinput` kernel module (`modprobe uinput`).

You need to disconnect and restart it once you modify any monitor settings.

## Select Monitor via DRM Card and Connector

1. Find your DRM card name (e.g., `card0`) and connector name (e.g., `DP-1`) in `/sys/class/drm/`.
2. Copy and modify the example configuration.
	```
	# cp /etc/reframe/example.conf /etc/reframe/DP-1.conf
	```
3. Set `card` and `connector` values.
4. Set the value of `rotation` to the angle you rotate your monitor.

If you cannot resize your VNC client window, or you don't want to resize the VNC client window manually every time, you can set values of `default-width` and `default-height`.

Then start the ReFrame Server systemd service so it will listen to VNC clients.

```
# systemctl start reframe-server@DP-1.service
```

ReFrame Server systemd service should automatically pull ReFrame systemd socket, which will trigger the privileged ReFrame Streamer systemd service on demand. If not, start the ReFrame systemd socket manually.

```
# systemctl start reframe@DP-1.socket
```

## Multi-monitor

If you have more than 1 monitors, you need to set the size of the whole virtual desktop and the position offset of your selected monitor to make pointer position mapping work.

All things mentioned here is only about the **logical** position of monitors, which is generally how you place them in the *Display* page of *Settings*, and have nothing about how you place them physically.

Unfortunately there is no general way to get those values for all desktop environments. You could run a program that reports the current cursor position, and then move the cursor to get the following values.

- `desktop-width`: The x coordinate of right border of your rightmost monitor.
- `desktop-height`: The y coordinate of bottom border of your bottommost monitor.
- `monitor-x` and `monitor-y`: The x and y coordinates of top-left corner of your selected monitor.

Here is an example about what those keys are and how to find their values:

![monitor-mapping.drawio.svg](./docs/images/monitor-mapping.drawio.svg)

You need to keep the same multi-monitor layout for **both user session and display manager session** to make remote login work correctly. For example, to sync monitor layout of your user session to GDM's display manager session:

```
# cp /home/YOURUSER/.config/monitors.xml /etc/xdg/monitors.xml
```

## Specific IP Addresses

If you don't want to accpet incoming connections from all IP addresses, for example, you want to only accept incoming connections from your LAN or VPN, you can set the value of `ip` to a `;` seperated list like this:

```
ip=192.168.1.3;10.10.10.3
```

This is supported with libvncserver and neatvnc stable (`>=1.0.0`), with neatvnc unstable we only support to listen the first given IP address.

Leaving it empty will accept all incoming connections from all IP addresses.

## Headless Setup

This program only works with connected monitors, however if you have no monitor ("headless"), you can still use it, because Linux kernel could force enable a connector to pretend there is a monitor.

1. **Choose an unused connector**: For example add kernel parameter `video="DP-1:D"` to enable `DP-1`.
2. **Set resolution via EDID override**: You can dump your real monitor's EDID from `/sys/class/drm/card*-*/edid` or download a virtual one, put it to `/lib/firmware/edid/`, for example `/lib/firmware/edid/1280x720.bin`, and then add kernel parameter `drm.edid_firmware="DP-1:edid/1280x720.bin"` to use it. **If you have early KMS, also add those EDID binaries to your initramfs.**

Then you can reboot your system, and come back to modify the configuration.

## Automatic Wakeup

Desktop environments may turn off monitors if automatic screen blank is enabled, and ReFrame by default will try to wake system up by moving pointer a little bit so it could get monitor content.

This will introduce a ~2s delay before you can see monitor content, because your system needs some time to process the input event.

If you don't want this, you can disable automatic screen blank for **both user session and display manager**, then set `wakeup=false` in your configuration file.

## Clipboard Text Sync

You need to add your user to `reframe` group to use clipboard text sync.

```
# gpasswd -a YOURUSER reframe
```

If you set other username than `reframe` while building, the group name should be changed accordingly.

This is implemented by putting a desktop file to XDG autostart dir to start `reframe-session` with your session and handle your clipboard. `reframe-session` talks with `reframe-server` via sockets in directory `/run/reframe-session`, if you are not using systemd, or you changed the directory via `reframe-server`'s argument, don't forget to modify the XDG autostart file to change argument for `reframe-session`

You have to restart `reframe-session` once you update it, because the binary is changed. This could be done via log out and log in again.

# Comparison with Other Linux Remote Desktop

- [kmsvnc](https://github.com/isjerryxiao/kmsvnc/)
	+ ReFrame supports NVIDIA driver by decoding frames with EGL and OpenGL ES, kmsvnc uses VA-API and it cannot decode frames of NVIDIA driver correctly.
	+ ReFrame gets frame buffer on each frame, so it works correctly if your compositor uses double-buffers.
	+ ReFrame contains privilieged DRM/uinput process and unprivilieged VNC server process, kmsvnc runs as a whole privilieged process.
	+ ReFrame supports resizing client window.
- [RustDesk](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/)
	+ ReFrame supports Remote Login on Wayland, [RustDesk does not support it](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/client/linux/#login-screen).
- [GNOME Remote Desktop](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-remote-desktop/)
	+ ReFrame supports non-GNOME desktop environments.
	+ ReFrame supports Remote Login with VNC, GNOME Remote Desktop only supports Remote Login with RDP clients that implements *Server Redirection* (Microsoft's Windows App on macOS does **NOT** implement it and that's why I decides to write my own solution).
- [wayvnc](https://github.com/any1/wayvnc/)
	+ ReFrame supports non-wlroots desktop environments.
- [w0vncserver](https://tigervnc.org/)
	+ ReFrame supports Remote Login, [w0vncserver uses per-session XDG desktop portal](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/pull/1947), which means it cannot support Remote Login.
- [x0vncserver](https://tigervnc.org/)
	+ ReFrame supports Wayland.

# Special Thanks

I am very grateful to [@isjerryxiao](https://github.com/isjerryxiao/) for creating [kmsvnc](https://github.com/isjerryxiao/kmsvnc/) and for giving advice for what could be fixed or improved in it. ReFrame is heavily inspired by kmsvnc and I've learnt a lot from it.
